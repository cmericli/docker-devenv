# docker-devenv
Tools, utils, scripts, etc. for using docker as development environment with X and GPU support

TL;DR
About in late 2015, while searching for a flexible solution for establishing a development environment for different projects with very different dependencies / environments, I have devised a hacky-wacky docker practice and since then it got some traction in some of the projects I have been involved with. Therefore, I decided to put the tools, scripts, Docker images etc. here so perhaps someone else with similar needs benefit or at least inspire from. 

Some of the tools make heavy use of some other tools (like nvidia-docker)

If anyone have any suggestions / improvements / remarks, I would be delighted to discuss.
